# Growers Page Update

This document summarizes the changes made to restructure the technician's navigation to move the "Manage Cycles" and "Monitor Growers" functions from the Account page to the Growers page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated GrowersManagement.tsx

Added the "Manage & Monitor Cycles" function to the Growers page:
- Added a new "Management Options" section at the top of the page
- Included a card with the "Manage & Monitor Cycles" option that navigates to the Cycles tab
- Retained all existing grower listing functionality
- Added necessary imports for navigation and icons

### 2. Updated Account.tsx

Removed the "Manage & Monitor Cycles" and "Manage & Monitor Growers" functions from the Account page:
- Removed the two option cards from the "Account Settings" section
- Removed unused imports (BarChart3, Users icons and navigation)
- Simplified the component to focus only on account-specific settings

## Navigation Structure Update

### Technician Navigation (Updated)
- **Home**: Dashboard with technician metrics
- **Cycles**: Full cycle management
- **Growers**: 
  - Management options (Manage & Monitor Cycles)
  - List of all growers
- **Account**: 
  - User profile
  - Change password
  - Sign out

### Grower Navigation (Unchanged)
- **Home**: Dashboard with grower metrics
- **Cycles**: Cycle management for their own cycles
- **Account**: 
  - User profile
  - Change password
  - Sign out

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Management functions are now grouped logically in the Growers tab
2. **Cleaner Account Page**: The Account page now focuses solely on user-specific settings
3. **Intuitive Navigation**: Technicians can access grower-related management functions directly from the Growers tab
4. **Consistency**: Follows the project specification that requires "Manage & Monitor Cycle" and "Manage & Monitor Grower" functions to be located in the Growers screen

## Implementation Details

### GrowersManagement Component
- Added navigation functionality to the Cycles tab
- Maintained existing grower listing with performance metrics
- Added a new section for management options at the top of the page

### Account Component
- Removed navigation functions that were moved to the Growers page
- Kept only essential account settings (password change and sign out)
- Simplified the UI to focus on user profile management

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Technicians can access "Manage & Monitor Cycles" from the Growers page
- The Growers page still displays all grower information correctly
- The Account page no longer shows the management options
- Navigation between pages works correctly
- All existing functionality remains intact
