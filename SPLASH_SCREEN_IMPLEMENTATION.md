# Splash Screen Implementation

This document summarizes the changes made to add a custom splash screen to the Flockmate application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created SplashScreen Component

Created a new component at [src/components/SplashScreen.tsx](file:///src/components/SplashScreen.tsx):

- Custom animated splash screen with fade-in and scale animations
- Displays the app logo, title, and subtitle
- Automatically transitions to the main app after 3 seconds
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

### 2. Updated App.tsx

Modified the main application component to integrate the splash screen:

- Added state management for splash screen visibility
- Implemented a 3-second timer to automatically hide the splash screen
- Added a manual onFinish callback for programmatic control
- Integrated the SplashScreen component into the app flow

## Features

### Animation
- Smooth fade-in effect using Animated API
- Scale animation for the logo to create a welcoming effect
- Parallel animations for simultaneous fade and scale

### Design Elements
- App logo from assets folder
- "Flockmate" title in brand green color
- "Poultry Monitoring System" subtitle
- Clean white background for maximum contrast

### Timing
- Automatically hides after 3 seconds
- Can be manually dismissed via onFinish callback
- Configurable timeout duration

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface SplashScreenProps {
  onFinish: () => void;
}
```

### Animations
- Fade animation (0 to 1 opacity)
- Scale animation (0.8 to 1 scale)
- Spring animation for natural bounce effect

### Styling
- Flexbox layout for perfect centering
- Responsive dimensions using Dimensions API
- Consistent color scheme with brand colors
- Proper spacing and typography hierarchy

## Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**: Adds a polished first impression
2. **Branding**: Reinforces app identity with logo and name
3. **User Experience**: Smooth transition from app launch to content
4. **Performance**: Lightweight implementation with minimal overhead
5. **Customization**: Easy to modify colors, timing, and content

## Integration Points

### App.tsx Modifications
- Added useState hook for splash screen visibility
- Implemented useEffect for automatic hiding
- Integrated SplashScreen component in render flow
- Maintained existing authentication and navigation logic

### Asset Usage
- Reuses existing app icon from assets folder
- No additional image assets required
- Consistent with app branding

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Splash screen appears on app launch
- Animations play smoothly
- Automatic hiding works after 3 seconds
- Manual dismissal via onFinish works correctly
- No conflicts with existing app functionality
- Proper rendering on different screen sizes
