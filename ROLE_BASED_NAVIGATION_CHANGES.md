# Role-Based Navigation Implementation

This document summarizes the changes made to implement role-based navigation in the Flockmate mobile app, providing different functionality for growers and technicians.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated App.tsx

Modified the main application component to provide different navigation structures based on the user's role:

- **Technician Navigation**: 4 tabs (Home, Cycles, Growers, Account)
- **Grower Navigation**: 3 tabs (Home, Cycles, Account)

Key changes:
- Created separate navigation stacks for technicians and growers
- Implemented role-based routing in the `AppContent` component
- Added technician-specific screens like "Growers Management"
- Removed technician-specific features from grower navigation

### 2. Updated CustomBottomNav.tsx

Modified the bottom navigation component to:
- Accept a `userType` prop to determine which tabs to display
- Dynamically adjust tab widths based on the number of visible tabs
- Show the "Growers" tab only for technicians
- Maintain consistent styling across both navigation types

### 3. Navigation Structure

#### For Technicians:
- **Home**: Dashboard with technician metrics
- **Cycles**: Full cycle management including:
  - Start New Cycle
  - DOC Loading
  - Supply Delivery
  - Resubmit Supply Delivery
  - Manage & Monitor Cycle
  - Manage & Monitor Grower
  - Make Harvest
  - Resubmit Harvest
  - Reconciliation of Performance
  - Post-harvest
- **Growers**: Grower management features
- **Account**: User settings including Growers Management

#### For Growers:
- **Home**: Dashboard with grower metrics
- **Cycles**: Cycle management for their own cycles:
  - DOC Loading
  - Supply Delivery
  - Make Harvest
  - Reconciliation of Performance
  - Post-harvest
- **Account**: User settings (without Growers Management)

## Technical Implementation

### Role Detection
The user's role is determined from the Supabase user metadata:
```typescript
const { user, loading, role } = useAuth();
```

### Conditional Rendering
Navigation is rendered based on the user's role:
```typescript
{user ? (
  role === 'technician' ? <TechnicianTabs /> : <GrowerTabs />
) : (
  <Login />
)}
```

### Dynamic Tab Filtering
The CustomBottomNav component filters tabs based on user type:
```typescript
const getFilteredRoutes = () => {
  if (userType === 'technician') {
    // Technicians see all routes including Growers
    return state.routes;
  } else {
    // Growers don't see the Growers tab
    return state.routes.filter(route => route.name !== 'Growers');
  }
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Role-Specific Experience**: Users only see features relevant to their role
2. **Cleaner Interface**: Growers have a simplified navigation without unnecessary complexity
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add role-specific features in the future
4. **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns with distinct navigation stacks
5. **Performance**: Reduced UI complexity for growers leads to better performance

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Technicians see all 4 tabs with appropriate functionality
- Growers see only 3 tabs without the Growers management section
- Navigation between tabs works correctly for both user types
- All existing functionality remains intact
