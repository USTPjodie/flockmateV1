## Design Elements

### Header Structure
- Consistent panel header across all main pages
- Title and subtitle on the left
- Notification bell icon on the right
- Clean, modern design with subtle shadows

### Notification Badge
- Red circular badge positioned at the top-right of the bell icon
- White text with bold font for visibility
- Different notification counts for each page to demonstrate flexibility

### Styling
- Consistent styling across all pages
- Proper spacing and alignment
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Visual feedback on press with activeOpacity

## Benefits

1. **Consistent UX**: All main pages now have the same header structure
2. **Easy Access**: Users can access notifications from any main page
3. **Visual Consistency**: Unified design language across the application
4. **Scalability**: Easy to modify notification count or add additional functionality
5. **Professional Appearance**: Modern, clean design that enhances the app's look and feel

## Implementation Details

### Components Used
- [Bell](file:///c%3A/Users/JODIE/Desktop/React/FlockmateV4/EnviroTrack/temp-expo-app/src/Home.tsx#L4-L4) icon from lucide-react-native
- [TouchableOpacity](file:///c%3A/Users/JODIE/Desktop/React/FlockmateV4/EnviroTrack/temp-expo-app/src/Cycles.tsx#L36-L41) for interactive elements
- Absolute positioning for the notification badge
- Shadow effects for depth

### Functionality
- Each page has its own [handleNotificationPress](file:///c%3A/Users/JODIE/Desktop/React/FlockmateV4/EnviroTrack/temp-expo-app/src/Home.tsx#L28-L30) function (currently just logs to console)
- Notification counts are hardcoded for demonstration (can be made dynamic later)
- Bell icon press provides visual feedback with activeOpacity

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Notification Counts**: Connect to a real notification system
2. **Notification Popup**: Implement a dropdown or modal when the bell is pressed
3. **Badge Visibility**: Hide badge when notification count is zero
4. **Animation**: Add subtle animations for better user experience
5. **Accessibility**: Add proper accessibility labels and traits
