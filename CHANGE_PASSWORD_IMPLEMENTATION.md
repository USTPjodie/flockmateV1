### 3. Updated Account.tsx

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```typescript

  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  // Component implementation
}
```

### Navigation Pattern

  ```typescript
  const handleChangePasswordPress = () => {
    navigation.navigate('ChangePassword');
  };
  ```

### Supabase Integration
- Re-authentication with current password:
  ```typescript
  await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email: user?.email || '',
    password: currentPassword,
  });
  ```
- Password update:
  ```typescript
  await supabase.auth.updateUser({
    password: newPassword,
  });
  ```
