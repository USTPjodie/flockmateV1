# Header Spacing Improvement

This document summarizes the changes made to add spacing in the header to prevent elements from being too cramped in the top margin.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Home.tsx

Added spacing to the panel header:
- Added `marginTop: 16` to create space at the top of the header
- Added `paddingHorizontal: 8` to add horizontal padding
- Improved overall visual balance of the header elements

### 2. Updated Cycles.tsx

Added the same spacing to the panel header:
- Added `marginTop: 16` to create space at the top of the header

- Maintained consistency with other pages

### 3. Updated Account.tsx

### 4. Updated GrowersManagement.tsx

Added spacing to the panel header:

## Design Improvements

### Before (Cramped Header):
- Headers were flush with the top of the screen
- Elements appeared crowded
- Poor visual hierarchy

### After (Improved Spacing):
- 16pt margin at the top provides breathing room
- 8pt horizontal padding prevents elements from touching screen edges
- Better visual balance and hierarchy
- More professional appearance

## Benefits

2. **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Proper spacing creates a clearer visual structure
3. **Enhanced UX**: More comfortable viewing experience
4. **Consistency**: All pages now have the same spacing treatment
