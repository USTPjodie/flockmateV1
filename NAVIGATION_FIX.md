# Navigation Fix for Growers Page

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the navigation issue where the Growers page was showing the same content as the Account page.

## Problem Identified

The issue was in the App.tsx file where both the "Growers" and "Account" tabs were using the same navigation stack (`TechnicianAccountStack`), which meant they were both displaying the Account component instead of their respective components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated App.tsx

Created a separate navigation stack for the Growers tab:

- **Created TechnicianGrowersStack**: A new stack navigator that displays the `GrowersManagement` component
- **Fixed TechnicianTabs**: Updated the "Growers" tab to use `TechnicianGrowersStack` instead of `TechnicianAccountStack`
- **Maintained TechnicianAccountStack**: Kept the existing account stack for the "Account" tab

### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
<Tab.Screen 
  name="Growers" 
  component={TechnicianAccountStack} // Wrong component
  options={/* ... */}
/>
<Tab.Screen 
  name="Account" 
  component={TechnicianAccountStack}
  options={/* ... */}
/>
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
<Tab.Screen 
  name="Growers" 
  component={TechnicianGrowersStack} // Correct component
  options={/* ... */}
/>
<Tab.Screen 
  name="Account" 
  component={TechnicianAccountStack}
  options={/* ... */}
/>
```

## Navigation Structure (Corrected)

### Technician Navigation:
- **Home**: Dashboard with technician metrics
- **Cycles**: Full cycle management
- **Growers**: 
  - Management options (Manage & Monitor Cycles)
  - List of all growers
- **Account**: 
  - User profile
  - Change password
  - Sign out

### Grower Navigation (Unchanged):
- **Home**: Dashboard with grower metrics
- **Cycles**: Cycle management for their own cycles
- **Account**: 
  - User profile
  - Change password
  - Sign out

## Benefits

1. **Proper Separation**: Each tab now displays its intended content
2. **Correct Functionality**: Growers tab shows grower management features
3. **Account Tab Focus**: Account tab focuses solely on user-specific settings
4. **Consistency**: Follows the project specification for navigation structure

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- The Growers tab now displays the GrowersManagement component
- The Account tab continues to display the Account component
- Navigation between tabs works correctly
- All existing functionality remains intact
- No duplicate content between tabs
